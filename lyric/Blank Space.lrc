[00:27.720]Walking through a crowd
[00:29.030]The village is aglow
[00:31.630]Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats
[00:35.710]Everybody here wanted something more
[00:39.790]Searching for a sound we hadn’t heard before
[00:43.280]And it said

[01:26.720]When we first dropped our bags
[01:28.460]On apartment floors
[01:31.150]Took our broken hearts
[01:32.690]Put them in a drawer
[01:35.290]Everybody here was someone else before
[01:38.670]And you can want who you want
